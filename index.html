				<h1>
					BAMBI
				</h1>
			</font>

			<font face="Comic Sans MS" color=white size=4.5>
				- Bambi has stolen Zardy's farm.
				<br>
				- If Zardy would one day come back to his farm, Bambi would throw a phone at him.
				<br>
				- Bambi's favorite Wii Game is Wii Sports.
				<br>
				- Bambi's favorite Wii Sports game is Bowling.
				<br>
				- Bambi goes to corn mazes and steals corn.
				<br>
				- Bambi is a god and has a religion.
				<br>
				- Bambi came into existence for no reason.
				<br>
				- Bambi can make friends with everyone.
				<br>
				- Bambi got his hat from a lost and found bin at a corn maze.
				<br>
				- Bambi can get so angry he loses his head, keeps his eyes and turns red.
				<br>
				- This is a reference to his jumpscare in Marcello's Fun House, where he does exactly that after the player collects the second notebook.
				<br>
				- Bambi mooches off of Dave occasionally.
				<br>
				- Bambi is made of H20, Helium, CS:GO microphone, and radiation.
				<br>
				- Bambi has a lot of hours on Counter Strike Source.
				<br>
				- Bambi hates anime.
				<br>
				- Whenever he wants to visit Dave, he teleports because he lives so far away.
				<br>
				- The Bambis in Cheating and Unfairness are not actually Bambi, and rather an entity known as Expunged, the reason why it looks like Bambi is because Bambi's joke sprite sheet is the first one they saw.
				<br>
				- Bambi has managed to get grounded twice.
				<br>
				- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHV62s9x1hs"> One time was when he destroyed the buildings because he didn't want to go to Cici's Pizza, he wanted to go to Burger King for lunch instead. </a>
				<br>
				- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L9pFN7QCkQ"> The other time was when he built a deadly roller coaster and kills an "ugly kid" named Exbungo. </a>
			</font>
			
			<br>
			
			<font face="Comic Sans MS" color=yellow>
				<h1>
					TRISTAN
				</h1>

				- Tristan was adopted by Dave.
				<br>
				- Tristan is also on good terms with Bambi.
				<br>
				- Tristan's favorite game is "baldi dies".
				<br>

				<br>
				- Tristan is 9.
			</font>
			
			<br>
			
			<font face="Comic Sans MS" color=red>
				<h1>
					EXPUNGED
				</h1>
			</font>

			<font face="Comic Sans MS" color=white size=4.5>
				- Contrary to popular belief, Expunged is not stronger than Shaggy.
				<br>
				- Expunged is more powerful than Dave as seen by the things it does to the notes in Cheating and Unfairness.
				<br>
				- Expunged looks like Bambi because Bambi's joke sprite sheet was the first one Expunged saw when it came into being.
				<br>
				- The reason Expunged sounds like Bambi is because they lack their own voice.
				<br>
				- The character select menu mistakingly refers to Expunged as "3D Bambi".
				<br>
				- However, Entity's locked silhouette is correctly identified as "[DATA EXPUNGED]".
				<br>
				- Expunged has the ability to take any asset from the mod and use or mess with them however it wants.
				<br>
				- Unfairness Expunged is actually Expunged corrupting 3D Bambi's spritesheet.
				<br>
				It can do this with all spritesheets or assets as well as take their form.
				<br>
				- Expunged can summon Bambi Minions at will.
				<br>
				- Which means they're canon to the original mod as well, not only Golden Apple.
				<br>
				- Expunged's purpose is to torture whoever accidentally enters the 3D world as seen in Polygonized.
				<br>
				- It made up its own purpose because it thought it was fun the first time it did it.
				<br>
				- Expunged's True Form is based on his lore and is made by his creator.
				<br>
				- Expunged can be whatever skin tone he wants.

There's a lot of Easter Eggs and funny shit here so have fun searching i guess lol.
